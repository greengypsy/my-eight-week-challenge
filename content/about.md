## Who am I?
G'day folks! I'm Christina and I'm a business analyst by day, technical writer by night. 

## What is this blog about?
I've decided to take part in [Prana Athletica's](https://pranaathletica.com.au/) eight week challenge to improve my fitness and overall health. I also want to improve my understanding of how websites are created, given how fundamental it is to my jobs. So I've also decided to create a website blog to keep myself accountable throughout the eight weeks.
