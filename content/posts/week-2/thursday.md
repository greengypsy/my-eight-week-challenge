## Training

Today, I did the Power class in the afternoon. It was a tough one again - 30X3X4 second movements plus 30 seconds of rest after a set of three movements. I'm feeling the burn after yesterday's Lift class, so skiiing was especially difficult. But I got it done - another session done and dusted.

## Food

Today, I ate:

- Breakfast: Scrambled egg-ricotta on toast. Except I used olive oil instead of butter so it didn't taste as good.
- Breakfast dessert: Black bean cake.
- Lunch: Mince, capsicum, mushroom and Vetta high-fibre spaghetti. A few chickpeas and some salmon sashimi.
- Pre-workout snack: Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
- Dinner: Chicken breast pieces with a ricotta-spinach sauce. Cucumber and celery was also added to up my vegetable intake. Plus some avocado for healthy fat.
- After dinner: A bowl of soba noodles with chilli oil and soy sauce.

According to this app I'm using - MyFitnessPal - I've met my protein intake but fallen short on carbs and fats. I think I need to probably up my fruit and veg intake a bit.

Anyway, here's a photo gallery of what I ate today.
