## Training

Today was the Prana 2.8km Community run. I managed to get it done in a time of 18:29 which is a lot slower than my target of 15 minutes but was expected given my current fitness level. 

I also went for an hour walk in the afternoon, but it was more of a social walk then training. But, I'm counting everything :).

## Food

I ate:
- Pre run snack: Sliced up banana with peanut butter.
- Breakfast: Toast with scrambled egg and spinach.
- Lunch: Cajun-spiced chicken with green beans, cabbage and quinoa.
- Afternoon snack: Yopro yoghurt with strawberries.
- Dinner:  Beef burger meat with cucumber, beetroot, avocado and quinoa.
- Late night snack: Overnight oats.
