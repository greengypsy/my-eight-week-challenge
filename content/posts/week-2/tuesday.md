## Training

Today was kickboxing day. Without getting repetitive, it was hard, but I got through the session. No cramping today as I took care of my water intake.

Also, as part of the team challenge, I did 40 (2X10 on my toes, 2X10 on my knees) push ups today, meaning I have 100 left to go for the rest of the week. 

## Food

Today was a tough day as I was busy at work and couldn't snack as much as I'd like. Anyway, this is what I ate:

- Breakfast: Overnight oats with peanut butter and berries (only finished half).
- Lunch: Beef burger meat with some avocado salad and soba noodles mixed with chilli oil and soy sauce.
- Dinner: Mince, capsicum, mushroom and Vetta high-fibre spaghetti with chilli oil and soy sauce. I had another serving of the same meal, this time with soba noodles
- Snack: A bowl of soba noodles with chilli oil and soy sauce.
