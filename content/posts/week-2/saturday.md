## Training

I did a HIIT class at 8:15. There were three pods (sets) worth of exercises and a corner run after each set. I think I did ok. I really tried to push myself on the corner runs so I can improve my time for the 2.8k run.

## Food

I ate:

- Breakfast: Egg-ricotta and butter on toast.
- Lunch: Beef strips, broccoli, cabbage, avocado, cucumber and quinoa.
- Dinner: Cajun-spiced chicken breast, cabbage, celery and soba noodles.
- Post-dinner snack: Chickpea nutella with strawberries.

As for tracking on the MyFitnessPal app, I smashed my protein target today and just fell short of my fiber target. I also didn't hit my carb or fat intake today so something to think about for next week.
