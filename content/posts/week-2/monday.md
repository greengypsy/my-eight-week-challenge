## Training

Today was a solid session of training to begin week 2 of the eight-week challenge. I did the Speed class followed by Lift. Sometimes, Speed is a fairly cardio heavy class but today there was a good balance between weights, cardio and whatever box jumping is haha. I struggled a bit in Lift today - was cramping in my calf. I don't think I've been drinking enough water so that's something I need to work on.

## Food

So this is what I had today:

- Breakfast: Overnight oats (only finished half of it though).
- Lunch: My famous mince capsicum and mushroom dish with Vetta high-fibre spaghetti and a side of salmon sashimi.
- Snack: A banana sliced up with peanut butter.
- Dinner: My celery, carrot and cucumber salad from last night with the chicken-ricotta-spinach thing I made on Saturday. Topped off with some extra soba noodles. Note: I ate more than what the photo suggests. I may have had extra chicken as I was still hungry.
- Snack: Some baked potato. 

I've lost around a kilo and a half since the weigh in pre-challenge so I'm pretty happy with my efforts. Hopefully, I can keep it up.
