## Training

Today, I did a kickboxing session in the morning and it was a spicy one. Still a bit sore from Lift on Wednesday and yesterday's core finisher but got the job done again. 

Here's a few highlights:

Though it isn't really training, I walked for an hour today too.

## Food

Here's what I ate today:

- Pre-workout snack: Half a banana cut up with peanut butter.
- Post-workout snack: Black bean cake.
- Lunch: Chicken, cottage cheese, spinach, soba noodles and some cucumber.
- Dessert: Yoghurt and blueberries.
- Mid-afternoon snack: Soba noodles with chilli oil and soy sauce.
- Dinner: Grass-fed beef strips with broccoli and green beans. 
- Post-dinner snack: Some soba noodles with avocado.
- Post-dinner drink: A glass of carrot juice.

I hit my protein and fiber targets on the MyFitnessPal app which is good. According to the app, I still have 679 calories to spend but I'm not particularly hungry so it's time to call it a day.
