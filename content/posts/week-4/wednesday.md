## Training

I did the Speed and Lift (upper body) classes today and it was disgusting. Running and calories on the bike for Speed was an absolute joke. Lift was ok until the end when we had to pull and push a weighted sled - the worst. But it's over now, so I can regroup for tomorrow.

## Food

I ate:

- Breakfast: Scrambled egg and ricotta on toast.
- Lunch: Slow cooked lamb shanks in broth, some high-fibre Vetta spaghetti and green beans. A bit weird but it worked.
- Snack: Sweet potato fudge with dark chocolate, peanut butter, and dark chocolate chips.
- Dinner: Beef burger meat with leaf, tomato and avocado salad and high-fibre Vetta spaghetti.
- Post-training extra: Almond milk with a little bit of protein powder and chia seeds just so I can hit my protein target for the day.

Overall, another good day. In three and a half weeks, I've managed to shave off 2 kilos (hopefully of fat). Here's hoping I can keep that up.
