## Training

So today I did two classes - Speed and Lift. While Speed is a cardio class and Lift is strength-based, I also used my core a lot so am feeling it big time at the moment. But I'm happy with my efforts.


## Food

I ate:

- Breakfast: Yopro yoghurt with papaya.
- Lunch: Mince, capsicum, mushroom, green beans and high fibre spaghetti.
- Snack: Sliced banana with peanut butter.
- Dinner: Beef burger and avocado, cucumber and beetroot salad.

I was pretty strict today as I deviated from the meal plan on the weekend and it showed on the scales. I know you're not supposed to weigh yourself all the time, but I find it keeps me in check - I try and only eat what I need and not what's in the fridge.
