## Training

After a pretty tiring day, I managed to bring myself to Power (HIIT) run by The Rhys. It was a tough one, particularly at the end when we had to sprint corner runs. I also managed to get a couple of sets of band work done today as part of the weekly challenge.

## Food

I ate:

- Breakfast: Scrambled egg and ricotta on toast.
- Morning snacks: Lamb shank broth and Yopro yoghurt with blueberries.
- Lunch: A big juicy steak with broccoli and leafy salad. Baked potatoes on the side.
- Afternoon snack/dessert: Sweet potato fudge with peanut butter, dark chocolate and dark chocolate chips.
- Dinner: The crappy tempeh and spinach pesto thing I made the other day with so high-fibre Vetta spaghetti and the mince, capsicum, mushroom mix I made earlier in the week.

All in all, a pretty disciplined day. But I'm getting to the point where I am dreaming of a nice cheesy gnocchi, or a big burger with fries. But I'm going to save that for the week after the challenge :).
