## Training

Kickboxing was a bit of a nightmare today. I really hate the bike at the moment and am struggling with my legs. I had to do 50 cal on the bike as a warm up and then alternate between 5,6,7,8,9 cal and ten sit ups. It was all kinds of s$%&!!! But I'm happy again with my efforts.

## Food

I ate:
- Breakfast: Back to scrambled egg and ricotta on toast. Love it.
- Lunch: Airfried barramundi with high fibre spaghetti and salad. 
- Dinner: A spinach pesto thing I made yesterday with tempeh and quinoa. It was not good. I made the dish edible by adding my mince mix to it.
- Snack: Sweet potato fudge with peanut butter, dark chocolate and dark chocolate chips.

Again, I've been pretty strict to make sure that I make up for the weekend. Hopefully, it pays off.
