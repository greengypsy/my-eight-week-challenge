## Training

I did the double today - Speed and Lift (upper body). We did 3 movements for Speed - bike, kettle bell swings and planks. To be honest with you, I'm so tired right now that I don't remember what I did for Lift other than it was upper body. 

## Win of the day

I've been a bit late with my posts because I've been trying to work out how to track users watching my videos. Anyway, I worked it out and am pretty proud of myself :). 

## Food

Today was a better day. Highlight - I tried papaya with yoghurt and loved it. I've seen the coaches eat it at the gym and thought I'd give it a go - glad I did.

Anyway, here's what I ate:
- Breakfast: Scrambled eggs and ricotta with toast and a few banana slices with peanut butter.
- Lunch: Airfried salmon pieces, green beans, cauliflower and red rice.
- Afternoon snack: Soba noodles with my favourite chilli oil and soy sauce.
- Dinner: Yopro yoghurt, a bit of protein powder and papaya.
