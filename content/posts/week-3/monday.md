## Training

Another day, another torturous HIIT class. But it got done. Enough said :).

I went for a very light jog at night - it took me a time of 19:24 to run 2.84kms. Yes, it is slow but I'm hoping to gradually pick up speed over the next couple of weeks.


## Food

Today, I ate:

- Breakfast: Banana slices with peanut butter.
- Lunch: Beef burger meat with quinoa, cabbage, cucumber and beetroot. And a little piece of airfryed salmon.
- Afternoon snack: Toast with butter.
- Another afternoon snack: Yoghurt and strawberries.
- Dinner: Chicken, red rice and steamed cauliflower.
- Dessert: Chickpea nutella with strawberries.
