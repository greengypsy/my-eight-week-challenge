## Training

I did two classes today - HIIT and Core. They were hard classes as per usual but  I got it done.

Also, I've started to time my block runs - today's was a bit slower than yesterday (5:57/km). 

## Food

Today, I ate:

- Pre-workout snack: Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
- Post workout: Left over piece of bread, scrambled egg and ricotta (my sister's). Also had a protein shake with just half a scoop of protein powder, some ground flax seeds and oat milk.
- Lunch: Tapioca chicken and chicken dumplings from Joe Dumpling (Plant 4 Bowden). Not part of the meal plan I know but I think it's ok to have a cheat meal every now and again.
- Dessert: A drink called "chaga chocolate" with coconut milk from Nutrition Republic. Don't recommend it sorry.
- Dinner: Mince, capsicum, leafy salad with tomato and avocado and some soba noodles with chilli oil and soy sauce.
- Dessert again: Sweet potato fudge with peanut butter, 95% dark chocolate and choc chips.
