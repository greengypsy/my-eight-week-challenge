## Training

Today is Friday which means kickboxing in the morning + a nice core finisher. It also means a block run for a warm up which I timed today on Strava (4:13/0.72m). Not bad for a warm up. Overall, it was a pretty good session - I"m pretty happy with my efforts today.

## Food

I ate:

- Breakfast: Scrambled egg and ricotta with toast.
- Mid-morning: Sweet potato fudge (other ingredients include peanut butter, 95% dark chocolate and choc chips).
- Lunch: Mince, capsicum, mushroom, green leaf, avocado and beetroot with quinoa.
- Afternoon: Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
- Dinner: Cajun spiced chicken breast, green beans and soba noodles with chilli oil and soy sauce.
- Dessert: Yopro vanilla yoghurt with a bit of protein powder and strawberries.
