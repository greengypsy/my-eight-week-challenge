## Training

Today was kickboxing. As you can see in my previous video [see Friday's post from last week](../../week-2/friday-day-12), I don't really extend my arms when I box, so I was really trying to work on that today. Hopefully in my next video, you see a difference.


## Food

I'm going to declare upfront that today was a really bad day. I started off well but ended up eating around four mini sausages (which I didn't photograph...).

Anyway, you know the drill:

- Breakfast: Scrambled egg with ricotta.
- Lunch: Mince and quinoa salad.
- Dinner: Cajun spiced chicken, quinoa, cauliflower and cucumber salad.
- Post-dinner: What was meant to be one sausage ended up being four. Oh well...
