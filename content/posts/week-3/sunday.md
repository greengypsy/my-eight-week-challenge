## Training

Today was the Prana Community Run where we did two 1.4K runs with a 2-minute break in between. With my running partner Lisa, I managed to run the first 1.4ks in a time of 8:26 and the second 1.4ks in 8:12. I've got a lot of work to do obviously, but am pretty happy with that for now.


## Food

I ate:

- Pre-run snack: Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
- Brunch: Scrambled eggs with two slices of sourdough bread, butter, spinach and some of Mel's bacon.
- Afternoon snacks: Yopro yoghurt with blueberries and sweet potato, chocolate and peanut butter fudge.
- Dinner: TBA
