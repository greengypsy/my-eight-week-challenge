## Training

Today was a pretty light day. Wasn't feeling great, and I had another commitment so I did the 30 minute Core session. My abs feel like a baby elephant has sat on them. And I've signed up for Core on Saturday too. Yay for me...


## Food

As I didn't train much today, I don't feel particularly hungry, so not a lot of snacking.

Anyway, here's what I ate:

- Breakfast: Scrambled egg and ricotta on toast.
- Lunch: Cabbage, red rice, mince, capsicum and mushroom. Plus a few green beans.
- Dinner: Airfried salmon, leafy salad with beetroot and avocado and quinoa.
- Snack: Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
