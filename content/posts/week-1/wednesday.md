## Training

Today, I did the Speed (20min) and Lift (50min) classes just like Monday, except that Lift was focussed entirely on upper body exercises.

Speed involved 50 calorie sprints and then some rest equal to the time you took to complete the 50 calories. We were meant to do three lots of sprints but I could only burn 130 calories so I'm a bit annoyed. My legs are still shot from the Lift class on Monday. But it gives me something to work on.

Lift was alright but I was so hungry after. I think I might have to consider upping my protein intake but I'll see where I'm at later in the week and readjust.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: One scrambled egg mixed with ricotta again. It's really good.
- Lunch: The lean mince, cabbage, capsicum and mushroom dish again. Added some asparagus too.
- Dinner: Lamb shanks with broth again.
- Snacks: 
    - A full banana sliced up with peanut butter on each slice.
    - Some YoPro high protein yoghurt with a few blueberries.
    - Some roasted cauliflower with peanut butter and olive oil. 
    - A little piece of beef burger meat with some soba noodles with chilli-infused oil and soy sauce as I was still hungry after Lift.
    - Some more soba noodles with chilli-infused oil and soy sauce as I was still hungry after the burger.

I fear that I snacked too much today and ate too much peanut butter :(. Given that I've packed the extra cauliflower tomorrow which has peanut butter, I might skip my beloved banana with peanut butter tomorrow and just have the banana.
