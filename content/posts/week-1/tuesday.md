## Training

Today, I had a kickboxing PT session (45min) with coach Darian at Prana. It's hard work and sometimes I regret my life choices while I'm there, but once the session is over, I'm so glad I've done it. I've been going to these sessions for at least a year now, for at least two times a week and it's really improved my fitness. I highly recommend you try kickboxing with Darian - he's a hard task master but you'll get a lot out of it.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: One scrambled egg mixed with ricotta.
- Lunch: The lean mince, cabbage, capsicum and mushroom dish again.
- Dinner: Lamb shanks with broth again with some asparagus.
- Snacks: 
    - A full banana sliced up with peanut butter on each slice (pre-workout snack).
    - Some YoPro high protein yoghurt with a few blueberries.
