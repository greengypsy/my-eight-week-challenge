## Training

Today, I did the Speed (20min) and lower body Lift (50min)n classes at Prana. For those of you that don't know, Speed is a cardio-based class with lots of bike work paired with either running or lifting medium weights. Lift is a strength-based class with a lot of heavy weights lifting.

## Food

Here's a summary of what I ate today:

- Breakfast: Overnight oats with peanut butter and mixed berries.
- Lunch: The lean mince, cabbage, capsicum and mushroom dish I prepared yesterday.
- Dinner: Lamb shanks with broth and cauliflower.
- Snacks: 
  - A full banana sliced up with peanut butter on each slice (pre-workout snack).
  - A glass of carrot juice (after dinner).
- A little extra: I bought salmon sashimi today at work cos I was still hungry after lunch.
