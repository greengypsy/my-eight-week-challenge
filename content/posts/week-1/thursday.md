## Training

I did Power today and it was pretty tough. After a block run and a 5 minute warm up, we did 3 rounds of 10 minutes worth exercise - an upper body pod, a lower body pod and a kettle bell pod. Exercises included things like renegade rows, commandos, lunges and sleds. After completing 1 round of exercises at a pod, we had to do a right corner run and then repeat the round until the 10 minutes was over. 
I'm glad it's over haha but I feel like I got a lot out of today.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: One scrambled egg mixed with ricotta yet again.
- Lunch: The lean mince, cabbage, capsicum and mushroom dish repeated with some cauliflower from last nigh and a side of salmon sashimi.
- Dinner: Cajun spiced chicken breast 
- Snacks: 
    - Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter on each slice.
    - An oat milk mocha. Pretty sure that wasn't in the meal plan but oh well...
