## Training

I've been dreading today's 2.8km community run all week. But I got it done without stopping once, so I'm pretty proud of myself. I'm a bit annoyed that I didn't time myself - I set up Strava on my new phone and everything - but forgot to start the timer. It's all good though, I'll time myself next week.

## Food

Today was basically all about using up what's in the fridge. So mind me if the combinations get a bit weird.

Here's what I ate:
- Breakfast: Had a medium banana sliced up with peanut butter pre run and then the [chickpea-hazelnut mousse I made yesterday](../saturday-day-6) with some strawberries after the run.
- Lunch: Beef burger meat, chicken breast and ricotta-spinach pasta ([made yesterday](../saturday-day-6) and some green beans)
- Dinner: Lasagne with some chopped up cucumber, celery and carrot served with mint leaves. 
- Snacks: 
   - Yopro yoghurt with some blueberries in the afternoon.
