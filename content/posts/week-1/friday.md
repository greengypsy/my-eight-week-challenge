## Training

I started off the day with a kickboxing session. It was hard work but also a bit of fun with some back spinning elbow strikes - it almost made me feel like a real martial artist haha.

## Win of the day

So, I've worked out how to add an image carousel to my pages!!!! That means I now have an easy way to add images to each of my challenge-series posts. I did use someone's else's script and tweaked it, but I'm still so happy.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: My fave - Eggs and ricotta on toast.
- Lunch: Lettuce, cherry tomato, beetroot and avocado salad with beef burger meat. And straight after, a small bowl of soba noodles with chilli-infused oil and soy sauce.
- Dinner: Tempeh bolognese with Vetta high-protein spaghetti and spinach. Inspo from [this recipe](https://theplantbasedschool.com/tempeh-bolognese/) and a recipe from [Prana coach Darian's new cookbook](https://payhip.com/b/VHzcn?fbclid=PAAaZW9y1GzuvqT5BHCzRMExJliGxX1xLI1CSQqwOttVhwXzkE4KZph6bE9jU).
- Snacks:
  - Yoghurt with blueberries and one blackberry (there was only one left).
  - An oatmeal-banana-choc chip cookie made by the wonderful Lisa.
