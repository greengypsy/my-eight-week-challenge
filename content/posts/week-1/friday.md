## Training

I started off the day with a kickboxing session. It was hard work but also a bit of fun with some back spinning elbow strikes - it almost made me feel like a real martial artist haha.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: My fave - Eggs and ricotta on toast.
- Lunch: Lettuce, cherry tomato, beetroot and avocado salad with beef burger meat. And straight after, a small bowl of soba noodles with chilli-infused oil and soy sauce.
- Dinner: Tempeh bolognese.
- Snacks:
  - Yoghurt with blueberries and one blackberry (there was only one left).
  - An oatmeal-banana-choc chip cookie made by the wonderful Lisa.
