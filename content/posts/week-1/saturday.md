## Training
I did Prana's 8:15 HIIT class today. There was lots of bike work, a bit of weights, kettle bell work and a core finisher.

Now I'm dreading tomorrow's run.

## Meal prep of week 2
I've got a fairly busy day tomorrow, so meal prep is today. I've made about three lunches worth of chicken, ricotta sauce and spinach.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: Half of the overnight oats made last night ([recipe here](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/overnight-oats/) + protein powder) and beef burger meat. It's weird, but I saw the beef burger meat in the fridge and couldn't resist.
- Lunch: Chicken breast pieces with a ricotta, pepita and flax seed sauce and spinach. Served with some high-fibre Vetta pasta from yesterday. Based on [this recipe](https://www.instagram.com/p/Clyr-ooprNU/?igshid=NDk5N2NlZjQ=) from Instagram.
- Dinner: TBA
- Snacks: 
  - Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
  - Finished off the overnight oats in the afternoon.
