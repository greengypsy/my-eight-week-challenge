## Training
I did Prana's 8:15 HIIT class today. There was lots of bike work, a bit of weights, kettle bell work and a core finisher.

I went for a 40-minute walk in the evening too. It's not training but I'm adding it here :).

Now I'm dreading tomorrow's run.

## Meal prep for week 2
I've got a bit on tomorrow, so I've done some meal prep today. I've made about three lunches worth of chicken, ricotta sauce and spinach.

I've also made a delicious healthy nutella. I got the recipe from [chocolatecoveredkatie](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/better-than-nutella/), a healthy dessert blog. The only difference is I used cacao powder and I had a lot less hazelnuts.

## Food
Here's what I ate today:

- Breakfast: Half of the overnight oats made last night ([recipe here](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/overnight-oats/) + protein powder) and beef burger meat. It's weird, but I saw the beef burger meat in the fridge and couldn't resist.
- Lunch: Chicken breast pieces with a ricotta, pepita and flax seed sauce and spinach. Served with some high-fibre Vetta pasta from yesterday (not the high-protein version I thought it was). Based on [this recipe](https://www.instagram.com/p/Clyr-ooprNU/?igshid=NDk5N2NlZjQ=) from Instagram.
- Dinner: Cucumber, beetroot and soba noodle salad with a bit of leftover mince, capsicum and mushroom from the week.
- Snacks: 
  - Half a banana sliced up with peanut butter.
  - Finished off the overnight oats in the afternoon.

And a small confession. I may have had a little bit of this delicious lasagne made by my sister. Not exactly contributing to the cause, but was worth the calories :).
