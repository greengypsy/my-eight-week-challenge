## Fitness testing
On Saturday, I went down to Grange Jetty to complete some fitness testing prior to the eight week challenge. The fitness testing included:
- 1 minute of push ups.
- 1 minute of sit ups.
- A beach run from Grange Jetty to Henley Jetty and back.

I was a bit worried about the run, as my aerobic capacity is not the greatest. But I got through it in a time of 28:42. 
I celebrated my run with an oat milk latte from Grange Jetty and am looking forward to improving my time over the eight weeks.

## Body scan

On Sunday, I went to Prana headquarters and got my measurements and body scan done. I've come a long way (I've put on 3kg of muscle since my previous scan with SA Body Analysis) but there's more work to be done. Here's to eight weeks of hard work!

## Community walk

Well, technically, it was meant to be a run. But I ended up walking as I was a bit sore from the day before. I'm looking to improve my endurance so I am **committing to running every week**. Yes, you heard it here. From now on, no more excuses :).

After the walk, I had another delicious coffee at Willow Bend in Croydon.

## Meal prep

After the walk and a bit of lunch, I got straight onto prepping meals for the week.  This included:

- **Lean mince, cabbage, capsicum and mushrooms** with red rice and a dash of chilli infused oil.

## Fail of the day

Full disclosure - I'm not a great cook. I just throw things together or follow recipes I find and hope things work out. But sometimes, things don't work out...

So for a bit of fun, I thought I'd include a section which acknowledges a "fail" of the day. I think it's important to learn from mistakes and try and have a laugh as well. 

So here's what happened today. For some reason, I cooked the oats and it exploded in the microwave. Hopefully, it will taste OK tomorrow with a bit of peanut butter and fruit. But I'll definitely let you know.
