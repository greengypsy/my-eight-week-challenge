      <description>Training Today was the Prana 2.8km Community run. I managed to get it done in a time of 18:29 which is a lot slower than my target of 15 minutes but was expected given my current fitness level.

      <description>Training I did a HIIT class at 8:15. There were three pods (sets) worth of exercises and a corner run after each set. I think I did ok. I really tried to push myself on the corner runs so I can improve my time for the 2.8k run.
Food I ate:
Breakfast: Egg-ricotta and butter on toast. Lunch: Beef strips, broccoli, cabbage, avocado, cucumber and quinoa. Dinner: Cajun-spiced chicken breast, cabbage, celery and soba noodles.</description>

      <description>Training Today, I did a kickboxing session in the morning and it was a spicy one. Still a bit sore from Lift on Wednesday and yesterday&amp;rsquo;s core finisher but got the job done again.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a few highlights:
There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem to support it. Though it isn&amp;rsquo;t really training, I walked for an hour today too.

      <description>Training Today, I did the Power class in the afternoon. It was a tough one again - 30X3X4 second movements plus 30 seconds of rest after a set of three movements. I&amp;rsquo;m feeling the burn after yesterday&amp;rsquo;s Lift class, so skiiing was especially difficult. But I got it done - another session done and dusted.
Food Today, I ate:
Breakfast: Scrambled egg-ricotta on toast. Except I used olive oil instead of butter so it didn&amp;rsquo;t taste as good.</description>

      <description>Training I did Speed and Lift today.
Speed was a classic cardio session with bike, skiing, rowing, ladder work and a corner run to boot.
Lift was 100% upper body strength exercises.
Lift class: I&amp;rsquo;m working hard in the background again&amp;hellip; Food I ate a lot today, as the following list shows:
Breakfast: Silken tofu-banana icecream from the Fitchef cookbook. It was delicious! Lunch: Chicken, ricotta and spinach sauce with Vetta high-fibre spaghetti and salad.</description>

      <description>Training Today was kickboxing day. Without getting repetitive, it was hard, but I got through the session. No cramping today as I took care of my water intake.
Also, as part of the team challenge, I did 40 (2X10 on my toes, 2X10 on my knees) push ups today, meaning I have 100 left to go for the rest of the week.
Food Today was a tough day as I was busy at work and couldn&amp;rsquo;t snack as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>

      <description>Training Today was a solid session of training to begin week 2 of the eight-week challenge. I did the Speed class followed by Lift. Sometimes, Speed is a fairly cardio heavy class but today there was a good balance between weights, cardio and whatever box jumping is haha. I struggled a bit in Lift today - was cramping in my calf. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve been drinking enough water so that&amp;rsquo;s something I need to work on.</description>
