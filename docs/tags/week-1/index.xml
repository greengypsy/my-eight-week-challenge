      <description>Training I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreading today&amp;rsquo;s 2.8km community run all week. But I got it done without stopping once, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty proud of myself. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit annoyed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t time myself - I set up Strava on my new phone and everything - but forgot to start the timer. It&amp;rsquo;s all good though, I&amp;rsquo;ll time myself next week.
Straight after the community run Food Today was basically all about using up what&amp;rsquo;s in the fridge.</description>

      <description>Training I did Prana&amp;rsquo;s 8:15 HIIT class today. There was lots of bike work, a bit of weights, kettle bell work and a core finisher.
Saturday&amp;rsquo;s Power/HIIT class at Prana I went for a 40-minute walk in the evening too. It&amp;rsquo;s not training but I&amp;rsquo;m adding it here :).
Now I&amp;rsquo;m dreading tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s run.

      <description>Training I started off the day with a kickboxing session. It was hard work but also a bit of fun with some back spinning elbow strikes - it almost made me feel like a real martial artist haha.

      <description>Training I did Power today and it was pretty tough. After a block run and a 5 minute warm up, we did 3 rounds of 10 minutes worth exercise - an upper body pod, a lower body pod and a kettle bell pod. Exercises included things like renegade rows, commandos, lunges and sleds. After completing 1 round of exercises at a pod, we had to do a right corner run and then repeat the round until the 10 minutes was over.</description>

      <description>Training Today, I did the Speed (20min) and Lift (50min) classes just like Monday, except that Lift was focussed entirely on upper body exercises.
Speed involved 50 calorie sprints and then some rest equal to the time you took to complete the 50 calories. We were meant to do three lots of sprints but I could only burn 130 calories so I&amp;rsquo;m a bit annoyed. My legs are still shot from the Lift class on Monday.</description>

      <description>Training Today, I had a kickboxing PT session (45min) with coach Darian at Prana. It&amp;rsquo;s hard work and sometimes I regret my life choices while I&amp;rsquo;m there, but once the session is over, I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I&amp;rsquo;ve done it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to these sessions for at least a year now, for at least two times a week and it&amp;rsquo;s really improved my fitness. I highly recommend you try kickboxing with Darian - he&amp;rsquo;s a hard task master but you&amp;rsquo;ll get a lot out of it.</description>

      <description>Training Today, I did the Speed (20min) and lower body Lift (50min)n classes at Prana. For those of you that don&amp;rsquo;t know, Speed is a cardio-based class with lots of bike work paired with either running or lifting medium weights. Lift is a strength-based class with a lot of heavy weights lifting. It was a tough one but I got it done.
I&amp;rsquo;m working hard (during Lift), I swear&amp;hellip; Go back to Table of Contents</description>
