## Fitness testing
On Saturday, I went down to Grange Jetty to complete some fitness testing prior to the eight week challenge. The fitness testing included:
- 1 minute of push ups.
- 1 minute of sit ups.
- A beach run from Grange Jetty to Henley Jetty and back.

I was a bit worried about the run, as my aerobic capacity is not the greatest. But I got through it in a time of 28:42. 
I celebrated my run with an oat milk latte from Grange Jetty and am looking forward to improving my time over the eight weeks.
