      <description>Fitness testing On Saturday, I went down to Grange Jetty to complete some fitness testing prior to the eight week challenge. The fitness testing included:
1 minute of push ups. 1 minute of sit ups. A beach run from Grange Jetty to Henley Jetty and back. I was a bit worried about the run, as my aerobic capacity is not the greatest. But I got through it in a time of 28:42.</description>

      <description>Who am I? G&amp;rsquo;day folks! I&amp;rsquo;m Christina and I&amp;rsquo;m a business analyst by day, technical writer by night.
What is this blog about? I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to take part in Prana Athletica&amp;rsquo;s eight week challenge to improve my fitness and overall health. I also want to improve my understanding of how websites are created, given how fundamental it is to my jobs. So I&amp;rsquo;ve also decided to create a website blog to keep myself accountable throughout the eight weeks.</description>
